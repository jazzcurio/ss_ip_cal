I compiled these codes on Matrix with the following commands

>> g++ -std=gnu++0x a1q1.cpp a1q1myText.cpp pixmap.cpp

I tried on Mac, too. And it worked.
I think you can test my files on your MacBook.
If it doesn't work, however, please do it on Matrix.

input.ppm is the starting point of the test.

JustRed.ppm and answerX.ppm files are the Answer Sheets.
I made them with the paint bucket tool of GIMP.
